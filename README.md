Our generation is living in a new reality; experiencing an increasingly connected world where we are online 24/7, making excessive use of social media, and dealing with always-on workplace cultures. This brings new challenges to our mental wellbeing.

â€‹

Constantly connected on the outside, but often lonely on the inside, Millennials are trying to take advantage of this new reality, but often end up overwhelmed with overflowing amounts of information. Addicted to the feeling of instant gratification that comes with unlimited scrolling and mobile applications, and constantly comparing ourselves to our peers and their supposedly perfect lives on social media. 
 

As a generation, we realized that there are no tools out there that can help us cope. We noticed that even though we spend most of our time at work, most workplaces don't have a concrete conversation or support system that caters to our mental wellbeing. It turned out to be a taboo. Almost as if struggling and being human meant to be weak and incompetent!

 

As a non-profit start-up, we are dedicated professionals volunteering from all over the world, united by a common vision. Currently, we are working on delivering a holistic approach with a solution tailored to the needs of Millennials. Our motto is For Millennials, By Millennials, because we decided to find a solution to our very own problem. We want to reshape the workplaces and help our generation overcome the taboo of mental wellbeing.
